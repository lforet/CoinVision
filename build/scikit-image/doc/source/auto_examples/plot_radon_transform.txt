Radon transform
===============

The radon transform is a technique widely used in tomography to
reconstruct an object from different projections. A projection is, for
example, the scattering data obtained as the output of a tomographic
scan.

For more information see:

This script performs the radon transform, and reconstructs the
input image based on the resulting sinogram.
